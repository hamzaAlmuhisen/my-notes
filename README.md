Hello, my name is **Hamza Almuhisen** and I'm a full-stack developer with three years of experience. I'm thrilled to be here and I'm eager to take on the challenges that this semester brings. As someone who is passionate about technology and innovation, I'm always looking to broaden my horizons and acquire new skills. I believe that this semester will be a great opportunity for me to learn and grow both personally and professionally. I'm looking forward to working hard, making new connections, and achieving my goals.

# My life as programmer 

## 1. Don't Be a Hero Always Know When to Quit.
It's important to recognize when a task or project is beyond your abilities or resources. Knowing when to quit can help you avoid wasting time and effort on something that may not be feasible or worthwhile.

## 2. Simplicity, Simplicity, and Simplicity.
Keeping things simple can help reduce complexity, minimize errors, and improve maintainability. Strive to create simple and elegant solutions that are easy to understand and use.

## 3. Never Add Features That You Don't Need.
Adding unnecessary features can bloat your codebase, introduce bugs, and delay progress. Only include features that are essential and that provide real value to your users.

## 4. Google is Your Best Friend.
Whatever your problem is, small or very big, you can find a solution on Google. It will not only give you the reason for the problem but also provide you with the best practice to avoid it. Use it to learn and improve your knowledge.
## 5. If You're Stuck, Try to Fix It on Your Own. If You're Still Stuck, Google It.
As a programmer, you'll inevitably run into problems that you can't solve right away. However, you should try to solve them on your own first, and only seek help from others if you're still stuck. The programming community is generally helpful and supportive.

## 6. Always Use This Formula: D = V / E.
This formula can help you assess the value of a proposed change against the effort required to implement it. Determine how much you want the change to happen (D), how much value it offers to your users (V), and how much work you'll need to do to accomplish it (E).

## 7. The Optimum Code Is a Small Bunch of Code That Is Easy to Understand and Read.
Write code that is concise, well-organized, and easy to follow. This can help reduce bugs, improve performance, and make it easier for others to maintain your code.

## 8. Everything Takes Longer Than You Think.
Be realistic about the time and effort required for a task or project. Don't underestimate the complexity or the unforeseen challenges that may arise along the way.

## 9. There's No Shame in Talking to a Book or Doll and Explaining the Error You Faced.
Sometimes, explaining a problem or error to an inanimate object can help you clarify your thoughts and identify potential solutions. Don't be afraid to try this technique if it works for you.
